I developed a way to connect two Bsale systems  when one of them send stock to the other. It is pretty common in Peru to use two different RUC even for (technically) the same company. I like using Bsale, it is simple and friendly but on this cases it is just a pain in the ass not being able to transfer it from two different systems, I solved that.
